# chess-coding-problems
An attempt at a curated list of chess related coding challenges and answers I've encountered or invented over the past few years. Chess lends itself well to a wide variety of problems, including Dynamic Programming, Hash Tables, and Graph Theory. My hope is that this becomes a enjoyable resource for other chess playing developers.
